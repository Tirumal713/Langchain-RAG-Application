It focuses on employees to have clear expectations on work requirements, compensation, welfare, and career development, sets clear and specific standards, procedures, and a framework to spot and address deviations and violations of these standards.\n\nThe HR Policy provides direction in the growth of the organization in general, and management of employees in particular. It enables clarity and norming of practices on various issues related to HR management and works as a guide to standardization on various aspects of quality services, skill development, and performance appraisal through systems and processes.\n\nThe clear perspective of performance appraisal not only motivates the employees, but it also promotes faith in HR practices for required consideration for compensation and promotions. A sound promotional policy and discipline & conduct policy provide parameters to maintain high standards of morals and performance benchmarks at the workplace. A sound work culture provides a very healthy work environment to work with a smile. \n\nIt provides scope and opportunities to make concerted and conscious efforts to sensitize HR professionals to the value of making the HR processes measurable, and take them on the path to quality standards in Human Resource Development."
